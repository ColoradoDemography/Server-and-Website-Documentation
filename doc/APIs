Census API
Used primarily to enable the Census data user interface (https://gis.dola.colorado.gov/CensusAPI/)
Address: /demog?
Pulls census data in a json or csv format
Parameters
•	db: acs + 5 year version (acs1620 to access the 2016-2020 5 year acs) or c + decennial year (c2020). Default is the most current
•	type: json, or csv (default is json)
•	schema: no need to specify if using acs or 2010 census. specify sf1 or sf3 for 1980, 1990, and 2000 census. If you don't specify it will assume sf1.
•	field: comma delimited list of fields. If you specify fields, table parameter will be ignored. 1980 census format ex: t01001,t11003,t38013 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020 census format ex: p1001,p20003,h17a001
•	table: comma delimited list of tables. 1980 census format ex: t01,t11,t38 1990, 2000, 2010 census format ex: p1,p20,h17a
•	sumlev: 40 is state, 50 is county, 140 is tract, 150 is block group, 160 is place
•	state: any state (integer format, no leading zeros).
•	county: any county (integer format, no leading zeros). would be smart to also specify state.
•	geoid: comma delimited list. (no quotes, leading zeros are necessary) example: '08' is Colorado, '08031' is Denver County , '08031000701' is a Census Tract in Denver County, and '080010078011' is a block group in Adams County, and '0668154' is the city of San Luis Obispo, CA. (You can also use the integer format for geoid –geonum- by prefixing the geoid with ‘1’. San Luis Obispo would then be 10668154. There are good but technical reasons why I strongly favor the alternate format).
•	limit: by default, limit is set to 100 records. you can override it by specifying a new limit (not required)
•	moe: set moe=yes to add margin of error fields for acs databases (not required)

example: (return csv of sex by age table from acs0812 for delaware)
