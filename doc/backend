Our website and databases are run through a combination of Google Cloud and Github. The data is stored in Google Cloud and many of the applications, including the website, 
are run through docker containers in Google Cloud. Most of the code is maintained and updated in Github.

Our website is maintained within the Website_Grid repository. We also have a test version of the website in the website_new repository. The website is largely straight html 
code with some javascript as well, especially for the homepage that displays state and county statistics.
