# Database Overview

Demography's data was formerlyer split into two separate database clusters (split between two PostGIS Docker Instance / Data Container pairs) with the thought that:
- Some data needs to be served as fast as possible
- SSD (Solid State Drive) storage, the fastest currently available, is expensive

So essentially, the data was split into a 'fast' cluster, and a 'slow' cluster. 

Subsequent testing found that the speed difference between the two types was neglible for our database needs so now all databases are stored using standard persistent disks. This allows significantly more disk space for the same price.

### What's in the DOLA Database?

The DOLA database so far is composed of two schema's
- bounds
- estimates

Neither schema holds the data that it purports to hold, so they must be explained.

**Bounds** contains municipal boundary and special district data, along with copies of common (and unsensitive) DOLA Oracle data such as local government information.  It has a mix of geo and tabular tables.

**Estimates** contains estimate, forecast, and economic data generated by the State Demography Office.  It consists entirely of tabular datasets.
