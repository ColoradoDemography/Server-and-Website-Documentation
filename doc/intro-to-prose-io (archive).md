# Intro to Prose.IO

While you certainly can use Github for adding content, most of the day to day operations of the website  can be easily operable by all staff members.  Enter http://prose.io .

While a Github account (and thus membership to the organization) is required, it doesn't necessitate learning anything about Git or Github.  Staff members can essentially set up a Github account and then forget about it (well, as long as they remember their password).

Prose.io allows for an easy-to-use interface.  Content is written and edited in Markdown, but immediate feedback is available through the use of a 'Preview' button.
